Copied-in code or copied in dependencies: Files found in com.square.square_project.extensions and com.square.square_project.utils
were copied in from my side project

How long you spent on the project: About 6 hours

Anything else you want us to know: I definitely took some short cuts given the small scope of the assignment.
If I had more time, I would use DiffUtils to update items in the RecyclerView, have a better logging system,
support process death with a better caching system (with Room/Sqlite) in conjunction with SavedStateHandle in ViewModel,
follow a single activity + multiple fragment type of architecture, use Coroutine and Compose, etc
